            The Karachi Kings is the biggest and most popular team in the PSL. Proudly owned by Mr. Salman Iqbal, it is a manifestation of the multicultural metropolis that is Karachi, the heart and soul of Pakistan. The fan following of the team is not limited to Karachi, but is spread all across the country. More than being just a cricketing team, the Karachi Kings franchise aims to invest in cricket in Pakistan, developing and nurturing our local talent to be confidant and able, to perform on an international level.
            
            The Karachi Kings are coached by Mickey Arthur with Rashid Latif as Team Director.
